Known issues
Problems with the delete function I am not sure what the main problem is yet. 
I have not managed to get the overload funtions before the time was up.
problem with find that make the program run into an infinite loop I have not been able to work out the problem before turn in

Know parts that work
set will set the value and key into a node
find will find the value of a key even if it goes into an infinite loop
max and min will show key with proper value
print will print all keys in order of their values

other problems
ran out of time to get all more notes on my program
